# Project archived

This project is archived. It was originally created to work around a problem of launching `amd64` binaries on `arm64` M1 Apple Macs.

Since docker and podman (including desktop versions) now support multiarch containers, there is no need for this projects any longer. See [this link on aerolab for docker and podman multiarch](https://github.com/aerospike/aerolab/blob/master/docs/docker_multiarch.md) for more details.

The original readme is still here under `OLD_README.md` and this repo will remain for now for reference purposes.
